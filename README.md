## Assignment details

### Overview

The web application should be styled to be interesting and engaging for a user in the selected context. It should offer several views including:

- An adminstrator view, that can add delete question sets, assess responses, and add and delete users.
- A user view that can view questionsets, submit answers, and see the results of completed question sets.
- A general view that can just view aggregate results for quizzes. 

### Front end

- The user should be able to enter all necessary data required by the application (although this need not be stored). This data should be sufficient to run the algorithm, and validatedon the client side.
- The webpage must be implemented using HTML5, CSS and Javascript (or a subset thereof).
- All resources used (inlcuding pictures, javascript libraries, css) must be full referenced.
- The website must use HTML5, and CSS. The HTML and CSS must pass this validator.
- The website must work on chrome, firefox and internet explorer
- The website should have at least six pages/sections: 
1. one promoting the theme (and explaining how the quiz works) to users 
2. one displaying available question sets to users; 
3. one allowing answers to be submitted from users; 
4. one displaying results of assessments to users; 
5. one allowing admins to add remove question sets/users; 
6. and one allow admins to assess responses.
- There must be a consistent style (via css file) for all pages yet each page should be easily identifiable. There should be a navigation element, and a footer element displaying author information.

### Back end

- A user account and login feature, (as a minimum for administrators)
- The ability to propose new question sets and add users.
- A method to submit answers.
- A method to assess submissions.
- A method to see assessments.
